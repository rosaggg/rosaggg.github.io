    <h1>All About Me</h1>
    <p>I was born and raised in Texas. Spent the first 18 years of my life there until I went of to college in NY. I studied biology and anthropology in college. Did some traveling after college. Went to Hawaii and then California. Finally I made the big decision to travel to China where I would spend the next 5 years teachhing English while I traveled around Asia.</p>
    <p>Currently I'm working on building a business with my sister. Most of my work is in product designing, working with Addobe Illustrator and Photoshop. I took the leap and decided to take the MITxPRO course in full stack development to one day expand our business into the eCommerce world.</p>
